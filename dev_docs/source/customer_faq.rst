Customers FAQ
---------------
These are list of general questions customers asked during introduction to Bodo. These are not technical on how to use Bodo. 

The plan is to collect them here along with the answers so we know what to say when they are asked again. 

Please add questions you were asked here. Also, add answers to the ones you know.

#. Does the code fallback to regular python execution if it encountered a function not supported by Bodo?
#. Does Bodo work with GPUs?
#. Does Bodo optimize code to run directly on GPUs?
#. Does Bodo allow access to monitoring what happens in the CPU, memory, I/O, etc..?
#. How does Bodo handle scaling workloads? 
#. What are the actual customer examples people are using this for?
#. What does fault tolerance look like?
#. Can users extend Bodo?
#. What doesn't work?
    * `Unsupported Python Programs <https://docs.bodo.ai/latest/source/not_supported.html>`_.

# Bodo Core Engine

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/bodo-inc/Bodo/_apis/build/status/Bodo-inc.Bodo?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/bodo-inc/Bodo/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)

## The Most Efficient Data Science Engine

Bodo scales analytics/ML codes in Python
to bare-metal cluster/cloud performance automatically.
It compiles a subset of Python (Pandas/Numpy) to efficient parallel binaries
with MPI, requiring only minimal code changes.
Bodo is orders of magnitude faster than
alternatives like [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org).

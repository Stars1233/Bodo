The Most Efficient Data Science Engine
######################################

Bodo scales analytics/ML codes in Python
to bare-metal cluster/cloud performance automatically.
It compiles a subset of Python (Pandas/Numpy) to efficient parallel binaries
with MPI, requiring only minimal code changes.
Bodo is orders of magnitude faster than
alternatives like `Apache Spark <http://spark.apache.org/>`_.

This is a set of scripts for obfuscating the source code.

* obfuscate.py : This is the script that does the obfuscation for one or more file.

* do_obfuscation.py : This script invokes obfuscate.py to obfuscate hiframes/*.py ir/*.py transforms/*.py
  directories

There is much possible improvements to be made to the code. For example doing coherent obfuscation
across many files at once.
